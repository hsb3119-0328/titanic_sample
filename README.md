## In our report, group 11 will summarize data and use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck by using data of train set and gender submisson
All the information of data included in kaggle.com

 In these chart we split 2 main index are age and survived to analyzes the survival rate by age group and age, and creates bar and line plots to visualize the results\\
 When look at the bar chart we can see the survival rates generally decrease with age, with children having the highest survival rate and seniors having the lowest. However, there is a slight increase in survival rate for young adults compared to teenagers\\
 Move to linechart revealed that if the data for certain age groups is limited, the survival rate estimates might be less reliable and subject to greater variability
